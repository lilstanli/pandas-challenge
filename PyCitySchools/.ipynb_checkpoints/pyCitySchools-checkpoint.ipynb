    "1. Charter schools have relatively smaller student sizes than their District school counterparts, which has positive effects on their performances in both Math and Reading.\n",
    "2. Higher spending per student does not necessarily have a positive impact on student performance as is the case in district schools which is negatively impacted by the larger size of the school by student count. Better performing students in Math and Reading have lower spending per head with students spending increasing towards least performing students."
